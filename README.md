Gutenberg Gallery layout is corrupted in Safari
In this page : https://www.sylben.net/selections/ , I work with gallery blocks. It displays perfectly well on my computer but it doesn’t work on my Ipad or Imac : the photos within the gallery are of different sizes and they get out the block zone. As a result you can’t see the titles anymore and it all looks messy.
My understanding is that there is a conflict with Safari, at least with older versions of Safari since both my Ipad and Imac are rather old...
I have another page with Gallery blocks and I have the same problem:
https://www.sylben.net/accueil-option-4/
FYI, On this website :
WP 5.5.3
theme : Customify, but I tried with theme 2021 and got the same layout problem on imac and Ipad

In the end I don't think it has anyting to do with WP version or the theme because the same problem occurs on other websites using Gutenberg gallery blocks.

I was wondering if you can help with that issue
Thanks in advance for your feedback
